Meet our character Doofus, a cube that loves exploring green platforms called Pulpits. The catch? Pulpits don't last long and disappear within seconds. Doofus has set a challenge to walk on at least 50 Pulpits. 

Characters:
Doofus: The main character (a simple cube will work too).
Pulpit: A  metallic  platform where Doofus walks.

Guide Doofus to walk on as many Pulpits as possible. Be cautious! If Doofus walks off the edge, he falls and the game ends.
